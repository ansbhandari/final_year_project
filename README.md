Background
==========

This project is done as final year project for the course of B.Sc. CSIT under Tribhuvan University, Nepal.<br/>
<br/>
In this we attempt to make a process hibernate on Linux Machine. Due to various limitations we failed to reach there.<br/>
But with-in this limited time frame we learn/understand some of the basic working mechanis of
linux system. And at the end we just get successed to dump process information to file-system.
When some dummy or the same process virtual memory space is replaced by
that dump-file after some necessary modification, we can do the process hibernation.<br/>
Even when replaced with-out any modification, process can be rollbacked( turmed so as it is applicable on current session of the process only).
<br/>
<br/>
The program `alldump.c` under codes directory achives the same.<br/>

Future Works
============
Being base on this project codes and documentation, further research work can be done to achive the ultimate gole.<br/>
We also will be trying the same.
